1. Download the Docker Compose template file to the folder where Autocaliweb should have it's data (e.g. /opt/autocaliweb) using the command below:

```
curl -Lo ./docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gelbphoenix/autocaliweb/master/docker-compose.yml
```

2.  Edit the compose file using the comments to help, filling in your Timezone and desired binds

3.  Navigate to where you downloaded the Compose file and run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

And that's you off to the races! Continue with the [things after installation](#after-installation).

#### Using Docker compose:

```yml
services:
  autocaliweb:
    image: gelbphoenix/autocaliweb:latest
    container_name: autocaliweb
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
    environment:

    stop_grace_period: 15s
```

### Manual installation without Docker (on your own risk)

If you want to install Autocaliweb on your server without setting up Docker and Docker compose you can follow these steps (For an extensive installation and the uninstall guide look at the [relating wiki article](https://github.com/gelbphoenix/autocaliweb/wiki/Manual-Installation)):

1. Download the prep_autocaliweb.sh file with the following command and check it:

```bash
curl -Lo ./prep_autocaliweb.sh https://github.com/gelbphoenix/autocaliweb/raw/refs/heads/master/scripts/prep_autocaliweb.sh
```

2. Make prep_autocaliweb.sh executeable and run it as root:

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./prep_autocaliweb.sh && sudo ./prep_autocaliweb.sh
```

3. Download install_autocaliweb.sh and check it:

```bash
curl -Lo ./install_autocaliweb.sh https://github.com/gelbphoenix/autocaliweb/raw/refs/heads/master/scripts/install_autocaliweb.sh
```

4. Make install_autocaliweb.sh executeable and run it as root:

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./install_autocaliweb.sh && sudo ./install_autocaliweb.sh
```

5. Follow now the next steps that are shown after install_autocaliweb run successfully

## After Installation

1. **Access Autocaliweb**: Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8083 (http://localhost:8083/opds for the OPDS catalog).
2. **Log in with the default admin credentials**:
   ```
   Username: admin
   Password: admin123
   ```
3. Configure your Autocaliweb instance via the Admin Page

- A guide to what all of the stock CW Settings do can be found [here](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#basic-configuration)
- Make sure `Enable Uploads` is enabled in `Settings -> Basic Configuration -> Feature Configuration`

4. **Google Drive Integration**: For hosting your Calibre library on Google Drive, refer to the [Google Drive integration guide of Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/G-Drive-Setup#using-google-drive-integration).

> [!IMPORTANT] > **If you are migrating from Calibre-Web Automated please ensure that your cwa.db is renamed acw.db before start to load your existing settings**

## Deploy Requirements

- Docker version 27.5.1 (minimum)
- Docker Compose version 2.33.1 (minimum)

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**:

  - If you experience issues starting the application, check the log files located in the `logs` directory for error messages.
  - If eBooks fail to load, verify that the `Location of Calibre database` is correctly set and that the database file is accessible.

- **Configuration Errors**: Ensure that your Calibre database is compatible and properly formatted. Refer to the Calibre documentation for guidance on maintaining the database.

- **Performance Problems**:

  - If the application is slow, consider increasing the allocated resources (CPU/RAM) to your server or optimizing the Calibre database by removing duplicates and unnecessary entries.
  - Regularly clear the cache in your web browser to improve loading times.

- **User Management Issues**: If users are unable to log in or register, check the user permission settings in the admin interface. Ensure that registration is enabled and that users are being assigned appropriate roles.
